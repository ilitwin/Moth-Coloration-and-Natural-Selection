# Moth-Coloration-and-Natural-Selection
The goal of this project is to understand whether the proportion removed differs between dark morph moths and light morph moths and, more importantly, whether this difference depends on the distance from Liverpool. If the relative proportion of dark morph removals increases with increasing distance from Liverpool, that would be evidence in support of survival of the fittest, via appropriate camouflage.
